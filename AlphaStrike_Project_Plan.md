- **Improved ECM/Counter-ECM system** with proper range-based protection
- **Enhanced melee combat** with better damage scaling and adjacency validation
- **Type classification** of abilities as either passive or active
- **Utility functions** for easier ability integration and application

### Menu-Based Command System

The improved user interface makes the game more accessible:

- **Phase-specific commands** that adapt to the current game phase
